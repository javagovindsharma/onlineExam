
# Common Operation Service

The **Common Operation Service** provides shared functionalities and utilities that can be utilized across various microservices in the Student Management System. This service encapsulates common operations such as logging, error handling, and utility functions that promote code reusability and maintainability.

### Features

- **Logging**: Centralized logging to track the activities and errors across microservices.
- **Error Handling**: A unified error handling mechanism that standardizes responses and improves consistency in error management.
- **Utility Functions**: Common utility functions that can be reused in different services (e.g., validation, data formatting).
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized management of configurations that can be shared among services.

### API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                | Description                                      |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/common/log`           | Log an event or error message                    |
| GET    | `/common/error/{id}`    | Retrieve error details based on the error ID     |
| POST   | `/common/validate`      | Validate input data against predefined rules     |
| GET    | `/common/config`        | Fetch configuration settings for microservices    |

### Usage

#### Logging

To log an event or error, send a POST request to the `/common/log` endpoint with the following JSON payload:

```json
{
  "level": "INFO", // or "ERROR", "DEBUG", etc.
  "message": "A descriptive message about the event or error.",
  "service": "Service Name" // The name of the microservice logging the message
}
```

#### Error Handling

To retrieve error details, send a GET request to the `/common/error/{id}` endpoint:

```http
GET /common/error/12345
```

This will return detailed information about the specified error.

#### Validation

To validate input data, send a POST request to the `/common/validate` endpoint:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
  },
  "rules": {
    "name": "required|max:50",
    "email": "required|email"
  }
}
```

The service will return validation results, indicating whether the data is valid or if there are any errors.
