### Course Service

The **Course Service** is a microservice responsible for managing course-related operations within the Student Management System. This service handles the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of course information. It also manages associations between courses and instructors, schedules, and other course-related metadata.

#### Technologies Used

- **Java** with **Spring Boot** for developing the microservice.
- **Spring Data JPA** for managing course-related data in a relational database (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL).
- **Eureka Client** (Optional) for service discovery in a microservices environment.
- **Spring Cloud Gateway** (via API Gateway) for routing requests to the Course Service.
