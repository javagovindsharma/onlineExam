# Notification Service

#### Overview

The **Notification Service** is responsible for sending alerts and updates to students and teachers in the Student Management System. It handles various types of notifications, including course updates, attendance reminders, grade announcements, and other important messages.

#### Features

- **Send Notifications**: Allows for sending different types of notifications via multiple channels (e.g., email, SMS, in-app).
- **Retrieve Notifications**: Enables users to fetch their notifications based on user IDs.
- **Manage Notification Preferences**: Allows users to set preferences for how they receive notifications (e.g., email vs. SMS).
- **Batch Processing**: Supports sending notifications in batches for efficiency.

#### API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                     | Description                             |
|--------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/notifications/send`       | Send a notification to a user          |
| GET    | `/notifications/{userId}`    | Retrieve all notifications for a user  |
| DELETE | `/notifications/{id}`        | Delete a specific notification          |

#### Example Usage

1. **Sending a Notification**
   To send a notification, make a `POST` request to `/notifications/send` with a payload like:

   ```json
   {
       "userId": "12345",
       "message": "Your enrollment in Physics 101 is confirmed.",
       "type": "EMAIL"
   }
   ```

2. **Retrieving Notifications**
   To fetch all notifications for a specific user, use a `GET` request to `/notifications/12345`. The response will be a list of notifications:

   ```json
   [
       {
           "id": "1",
           "userId": "12345",
           "message": "Your enrollment in Physics 101 is confirmed.",
           "timestamp": "2024-10-01T12:00:00Z"
       },
       {
           "id": "2",
           "userId": "12345",
           "message": "You have a new grade available for Math 201.",
           "timestamp": "2024-10-02T15:30:00Z"
       }
   ]
   ```

3. **Deleting a Notification**
   To delete a notification, send a `DELETE` request to `/notifications/{id}`:

   ```http
   DELETE /notifications/1
   ```

#### Implementation Details

- **Technologies Used**:
    - **Spring Boot**: For building the service.
    - **Spring Data JPA**: For database interaction.
    - **RabbitMQ/Kafka**: For message queue handling (optional for asynchronous processing).
    - **JavaMailSender**: For sending email notifications (if using email).

- **Database**: The service stores notifications in a relational database (like MySQL or PostgreSQL), with a table structure that includes fields such as `id`, `userId`, `message`, `type`, and `timestamp`.

#### Configuration

- **Application Properties**: Configure the service in `application.yml` or `application.properties` for database connections, message queue settings, and email server properties (if applicable):

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/notifications
    username: your_username
    password: your_password

  mail:
    host: smtp.example.com
    port: 587
    username: your_email@example.com
    password: your_email_password
```

#### Testing

- The service includes unit tests for the notification sending and retrieval functionalities. You can run the tests using Maven or Gradle:

```bash
mvn test
```
