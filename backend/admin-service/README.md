### Admin Service

The **Admin Service** is responsible for managing administrative functions within the Student Management System. It enables administrators to configure system-wide settings, manage user roles and permissions, and handle other configurations required for maintaining and monitoring the system effectively.

#### Key Features
- **User Management**: Add, update, and delete users with different roles (e.g., student, teacher, administrator).
- **Role and Permission Management**: Assign or revoke roles and permissions for various users, controlling their access to different services.
- **System Configuration**: Allows administrators to update configurations across the platform (e.g., settings for notification thresholds, attendance policies).
- **Audit Logs**: Keeps logs of key system events and changes for auditing purposes.
- **Reporting and Analytics**: (Optional) Provides reports or analytics on user activity, system performance, or other administrative insights.

| DELETE | `/admin/users/{id}`             | Remove a user from the system                   |
| POST   | `/admin/roles`                  | Assign or update roles for users                |
| GET    | `/admin/config`                 | Get current system configurations               |
| PUT    | `/admin/config`                 | Update system-wide settings                     |
| GET    | `/admin/logs`                   | Retrieve system audit logs (for auditing)       |
| GET    | `/admin/reports`                | Generate reports on system usage and statistics |

#### Configuration

The Admin Service can be configured through properties in the `application.yml` file:
```yaml
admin:
  audit-log-retention-days: 90
  max-users: 1000
  default-user-role: "STUDENT"
  notification-settings:
    email: true
    sms: false
```

#### Usage Examples

1. **Create a New User**
   ```http
   POST /admin/users
   Body:
   {
       "username": "john_doe",
       "email": "john@example.com",
       "role": "STUDENT"
   }
   ```

2. **Update User Role**
   ```http
   POST /admin/roles
   Body:
   {
       "userId": "12345",
       "role": "TEACHER"
   }
   ```

3. **Fetch System Configurations**
   ```http
   GET /admin/config
   ```

4. **Retrieve Audit Logs**
   ```http
   GET /admin/logs
   ```

#### Dependencies

The Admin Service requires:
- **Spring Boot** for the service framework
- **Spring Security** for managing roles and permissions
- **Spring Data JPA** for data persistence
- **Database** (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store user and configuration data

#### Notes
- **Security**: The Admin Service requires role-based access control to restrict access to sensitive endpoints.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle growing numbers of users and configurations, especially in a distributed microservices environment.

The Admin Service is essential for ensuring the smooth operation of the Student Management System, allowing administrators to configure, manage, and audit the system effectively.
