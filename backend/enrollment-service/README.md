### Enrollment Service

The **Enrollment Service** handles student enrollments in courses within the Student Management System. This microservice enables functionalities like registering students for courses, viewing enrollment records, and removing students from courses as necessary. The Enrollment Service plays a crucial role in managing the relationships between students and courses.

#### Key Responsibilities
- **Enroll Students in Courses**: Allows students to register for available courses.
- **Manage Enrollment Records**: Enables retrieval and modification of enrollment data.
- **Unenroll Students from Courses**: Facilitates removal of students from courses, maintaining accurate course rosters.

#### Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot**: Core framework for building the service.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For database interaction and ORM mapping.
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing enrollment records.
- **Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka**: Enables service discovery, making the Enrollment Service easily accessible to other services.
- **RabbitMQ/Kafka** *(optional)*: Used for messaging when notifying other services (e.g., notifications for successful enrollments or changes).

#### API Endpoints

The Enrollment Service exposes a RESTful API with the following key endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint                   | Description                                      |
|--------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/enrollments`             | Enrolls a student in a course                    |
| GET    | `/enrollments/{studentId}` | Retrieves all courses a specific student is enrolled in |
| GET    | `/enrollments/course/{courseId}` | Retrieves all students enrolled in a specific course |
| DELETE | `/enrollments/{studentId}/{courseId}` | Unenrolls a student from a specific course |

#### Example API Usage

- **Enroll a Student**:
   ```bash
   POST /enrollments
   Request Body:
   {
       "studentId": "12345",
       "courseId": "CS101"
   }
   ```

- **Retrieve Student Enrollments**:
   ```bash
   GET /enrollments/12345
   ```

- **Unenroll a Student**:
   ```bash
   DELETE /enrollments/12345/CS101
   ```

#### Database Schema

The Enrollment Service relies on a database schema designed to handle relationships between students and courses. A typical schema might look like this:

- **Enrollment Table**:
    - `enrollment_id` (Primary Key)
    - `student_id` (Foreign Key, references Student Service)
    - `course_id` (Foreign Key, references Course Service)
    - `enrollment_date`

#### Inter-Service Communication

- **Notification Service**: After successful enrollment or unenrollment, the Enrollment Service may trigger a notification via RabbitMQ or Kafka to inform the Notification Service to send messages to the student or course instructor.
- **Student and Course Services**: Enrollment Service communicates with the Student and Course services to validate student and course information.

#### Error Handling and Validation

- **Validation**: The service validates the existence of both `studentId` and `courseId` before creating an enrollment.
- **Error Handling**: Returns error messages if a student or course is not found or if an enrollment conflict occurs.

#### Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements may include:
- **Bulk Enrollment**: Enroll multiple students in a course simultaneously.
- **Enrollment History**: Maintain a history of all enrollments, including previous courses and dropped enrollments.
- **Automated Notifications**: Set reminders for students about course start dates or deadlines for course enrollment.
